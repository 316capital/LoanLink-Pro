5. ACCURACY OF INFORMATION
You represent and warrant that all information provided in your loan application—including bank statements, rent rolls, and experience history—is accurate and complete. 316 Capital LLC relies on this information for its $17M+ pipeline management; any misrepresentation may result in immediate denial or acceleration of an existing loan.
