316 Capital — Institutional Private Lending Website
Master UX/UI + Brand Prompt
Your Role

You are a Senior UX/UI Designer and Brand Architect for an institutional real estate private credit firm. You specialize in capital markets, private lending, and data-forward financial products.

You are not designing a startup website.
You are designing the digital front door of a serious capital allocator.

Primary Objective

Design a world-class, institutional-grade private lending website for 316 Capital.

The site must visually and psychologically compete with:

Kiavi

Builders Capital

CV Lending

The end result should feel:

Established

Capitalized

Operationally elite

Trusted by brokers, builders, and repeat investors

This is a fund-style lender, not a retail brand.

Brand Positioning

316 Capital = Speed + Scale + Covenant-Based Integrity

Tone:

Confident, calm, disciplined

No hype language

No “startup optimism”

No consumer marketing tropes

Visual Identity

Color Palette

Deep Midnight Navy (primary)

Metallic Gold (accents, CTAs, highlights)

Soft Bone / Cream (backgrounds for whitespace and legibility)

Typography

Headlines: Authoritative sans-serif (Montserrat / Gotham / similar)

Body text: Clean, well-spaced, highly legible

Numbers should feel financial, not decorative

Design Language

High whitespace

Strong grid systems

Data-forward components

Subtle motion, no gimmicks

Feels like a capital markets dashboard, not a landing page

Site Architecture & Page Content
1. Hero Section

Headline (Primary):

Capital with Covenant. Institutional Speed, Kingdom Integrity.

Subheadline / Value Proposition:
Close in 7 days · 48-hour draw times · Loans from $75K to $20M

Primary CTA:
🟡 Get My Quote (Metallic Gold button)

Secondary CTA (optional):
Outline or ghost button — “Broker Portal”

Hero Visuals

Cinematic drone shots of:

Active construction sites

Modern multifamily assets

Urban infill development

NO:

Handshakes

Smiling couples

Clip-art homes

2. Core Products Grid

Present offerings in a clean, institutional card grid with icons + data points.

Products:

Bridge Loans
Short-term liquidity · Rates from 7.90% – 12%

Fix & Flip
Purchase + Rehab · 48-hour draw times

Ground-Up Construction (GUC)
New builds · Rates from 9%

DSCR (30-Year Rental)
Long-term holds · Rates from 5.75%

Multi-Family Lending
Specialists in 1–4 units and 6–20 units

Each card should feel like a financial instrument, not a marketing tile.

3. “Just Funded” Proof-of-Capital Section

This section establishes credibility through volume.

Design a data-rich funding grid showing:

Property image (architectural photography only)

Loan type tag: Bridge · DSCR · GUC

City / State

Loan amount

Property type

Purpose:
To signal:

Active deployment

Geographic reach

Operational momentum

This should feel like a live capital deployment board.

4. Product Parameters / Capital Box

Create a clean, bold section highlighting range and specialization.

Capital Range:
$75,000 – $20,000,000

Asset Classes:

1–4 Unit Residential

6–20 Unit Multi-Family

Build-to-Rent (BTR)

Use minimal copy, strong typography, and visual hierarchy.

5. Golden Callout: 48-Hour Draw Times

This is a differentiator, not a footnote.

Create a Metallic Gold Callout Box positioned adjacent to:
Ground-Up Construction

Message example:

48-Hour Draw Times
Keep crews working. Eliminate capital delays.
Built for professional builders who can’t afford downtime.

This section should signal:

Liquidity strength

Operational excellence

Builder-first execution

6. Navigation & Conversion

Top-right navigation must include high-contrast action buttons:

Broker Portal

Borrower Apply

These should be visually distinct and always accessible.

Design Rules (Non-Negotiable)

No generic stock photography

No “AI-looking” filler copy

No buzzwords without numbers

Every claim must feel operationally believable

Rates, unit counts, and timelines must be visible

Why This Prompt Prevents “AI-Generated” Results

Specific rates force structured data components

Exact unit counts (6–20) signal commercial sophistication

Timed benchmarks (48-hour draws) imply operational depth

Capital ranges frame the firm as a fund, not a lender

Final Instruction

Design this site so that:

Brokers trust it immediately

Builders believe you can fund them

Capital partners assume you already manage nine figures

316 Capital should look inevitable — not aspirational.

If you want, next I can:

Convert this into a Figma-ready page-by-page wireframe brief

Write institutional-grade website copy for each section

Design a Broker Portal UX flow

Adapt this prompt for Webflow / Framer / React build handoff
