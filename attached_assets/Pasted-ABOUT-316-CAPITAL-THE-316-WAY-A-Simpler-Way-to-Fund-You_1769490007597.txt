ABOUT 316 CAPITAL: THE 316 WAY
A Simpler Way to Fund Your Deals
Every great project starts with a big dream—whether you’re fixing up a neighborhood house, building your rental portfolio, or starting a new development from the ground up. But in real estate, if the money moves slow, the deal dies. Most banks are too tied up in red tape to help investors move at the speed of the market.

At 316 Capital, we’re changing the game. We’ve built a direct lending company that values your time as much as your vision.

The 316 Story
We didn't start 316 Capital just to be another lender. We started it to be a light in the industry—a place where investors can find honest answers and fast capital. We combine high-tech tools with high-touch service to get you a term sheet in under 24 hours.

We are founder-led and family-driven. We treat your $17M pipeline with the same care we’d give our own projects. Today, we’re known for simple pricing, fast wires, and a "Direct Match" promise: If you have a written offer, we’ll do our best to beat it.

Our Mission & Vision
Vision: To be the most trusted private lender in the country, helping our clients improve their communities—one property at a time.

Mission: To provide simple, fair, and fast funding to real estate investors of all sizes. We are committed to an "11 out of 10" experience, treating every client with the respect and urgency they deserve.

The 316 Way: Our Core Values
1. Integrity in the Details (Colossians 3:23)
We do everything with excellence. Whether it’s a small rental or a multi-million dollar construction deal, we work as if we’re serving a higher purpose. We do what we say we’re going to do.

2. Move with Purpose & Speed
We know that "hope deferred makes the heart sick." We don't leave you hanging. We respond with urgency because we know your deposit and your reputation are on the line.

3. Radical Honesty
We believe the truth is the best marketing. We offer clear floor rates—5.75% for rentals (DSCR) and 7.90% for bridge loans—so you know exactly where you stand from day one. No hidden fees, no surprises.

4. Stewards of Your Success
We aren't just a bank; we’re partners. We grow when you grow. We take responsibility for the process from the first click to the final wire at the closing table.

A Partner Who Has Your Back
Whether you’re flipping your first house or managing a massive portfolio, 316 Capital provides the three things you need most: Honesty, Speed, and Fair Pricing.
