# Chapter 4: The Funding Playbook

**Match the Loan to the Strategy—Or Watch Your Profits Vanish**

You've found a great deal. You've run the numbers. Everything checks out.

Now you need funding.

So you Google "real estate loans," fill out a form, and get 15 lender calls in an hour. They all sound the same. They all throw around terms like "LTV," "LTC," "DSCR," and "bridge loans."

You pick one. Maybe based on the lowest rate. Maybe based on who called first.

**Then you realize: You got the wrong loan for your strategy.**

You took a DSCR loan for a flip—and now you're stuck with a 30-year mortgage on a property you planned to sell in 6 months.

Or you took a hard money loan for a rental—and the 12% interest rate is bleeding your cash flow dry.

**The loan product matters as much as the deal itself.**

This chapter breaks down every major loan type, when to use each one, and how to present your deal so lenders actually want to fund you.

---

## Loan Product Guide

Let's start with the basics. Here are the five main loan products for real estate investors, and when to use each.

---

### Hard Money Loans

**What it is:**  
Short-term, high-interest loans secured by real estate. Designed for speed and flexibility.

#### Best For:
- Quick acquisitions (need to close in 7-14 days)
- Properties that don't qualify for traditional financing (distressed condition, no C of O, etc.)
- Borrowers with lower credit (580-650 range)
- Deals where speed matters more than rate

#### Typical Terms:
- **LTV:** 65-75% of purchase price (or as-is value)
- **Interest Rate:** 10-14%
- **Term:** 6-12 months
- **Origination Fee:** 2-4 points
- **Prepayment Penalty:** None (or minimal)

**Key feature:** Hard money lenders focus on the *deal*, not your financials. If the property has strong equity and a clear exit, you can get funded—even with average credit or limited experience.

#### When to Use:
- Flips with tight timelines
- Off-market deals where seller needs a fast close
- Properties that need significant work before they qualify for traditional financing

#### What to Watch For:
- High interest rates eat into holding costs fast
- Origination fees can add $5K-10K upfront
- Extensions can be expensive if the project runs long

**316 Capital Hard Money:**  
- 70-75% LTV
- 10.5-12.5% interest
- 2-3 points origination
- Extensions available at $750-1,500 (no rate change)

---

### Bridge Loans

**What it is:**  
Short-to-medium-term financing that "bridges" you from acquisition to refinance or sale. More flexible than hard money, lower rates, but still asset-based.

#### Best For:
- BRRRR projects (buy, rehab, rent, then refinance out)
- Value-add multifamily acquisitions
- Properties that need stabilization before long-term financing
- Experienced investors with solid track records

#### Typical Terms:
- **LTC:** 80-90% of total project cost (purchase + rehab)
- **Interest Rate:** 9-12%
- **Term:** 12-24 months
- **Origination Fee:** 1-3 points
- **Prepayment Penalty:** Rare (or minimal)

**Key feature:** Bridge loans typically fund both the purchase *and* the rehab in a single loan—so you don't need to front the construction costs.

#### When to Use:
- BRRRR deals where you plan to refinance after 6-12 months
- Multifamily or commercial properties that need lease-up or renovation before permanent financing
- Properties with strong ARV but distressed current condition

#### What to Watch For:
- Draw schedules (how rehab funds are released)
- Draw inspection fees ($100-300 per draw)
- Make sure the LTC is high enough to cover *all* costs (purchase + rehab + closing + holding)

**316 Capital Bridge Loans:**  
- 80-90% LTC (up to 100% for Vault members)
- 10-11.5% interest
- 2 points origination
- 12-24 month terms
- Flexible draw schedules

---

### Fix & Flip Loans

**What it is:**  
Specialized short-term loans designed specifically for flippers. Similar to bridge loans, but optimized for quick turnover.

#### Best For:
- Full cosmetic or gut rehabs with a sale exit
- Experienced flippers (3+ flips completed)
- Properties with strong ARV and clear comps

#### Typical Terms:
- **LTC:** 85-90% of purchase + rehab
- **Interest Rate:** 9-12%
- **Term:** 9-12 months
- **Origination Fee:** 2-3 points
- **Prepayment Penalty:** None

**Key feature:** Lenders expect you to *sell* the property, not refinance it. They structure the loan with this exit in mind.

#### When to Use:
- Fix-and-flip projects with 3-6 month timelines
- Properties in hot retail markets with fast sales
- When you want to maximize leverage (90% LTC means you're only bringing 10% to the table)

#### What to Watch For:
- Higher LTC = higher risk. Make sure your comps are solid.
- If the market softens and you can't sell, you'll need an extension or backup exit plan

**316 Capital Fix & Flip:**  
- 85-90% LTC
- 10-12% interest
- 2.5 points origination
- No prepayment penalty
- Fast closes (10-14 days)

---

### DSCR Loans (Rental Portfolio Financing)

**What it is:**  
Long-term investment property loans based on the property's cash flow (Debt Service Coverage Ratio), not your personal income.

**DSCR = Net Operating Income / Debt Service**

If the property's rental income covers the mortgage (DSCR ≥ 1.0), you qualify—regardless of your W-2 income.

#### Best For:
- Buy-and-hold rental investors
- Self-employed investors who don't want to provide tax returns
- Refinancing BRRRR properties after stabilization
- Building a portfolio without hitting Fannie/Freddie loan limits

#### Typical Terms:
- **LTV:** 75-80%
- **Interest Rate:** 7.5-9%
- **Term:** 30-year fixed or 5/1 ARM
- **Origination Fee:** 1-2 points
- **Minimum DSCR:** 1.0-1.25 (depending on lender)

**Key feature:** No income verification required. The property's cash flow is the only underwriting criterion (plus credit score and experience).

#### When to Use:
- Refinancing BRRRR properties after rent stabilization
- Purchasing stabilized rental properties
- Scaling a portfolio without maxing out conventional loans (Fannie/Freddie cap at 10 properties)
- Self-employed investors who prefer not to show tax returns

#### What to Watch For:
- Higher interest rates than conventional (but worth it for the flexibility)
- DSCR requirements vary by lender (some require 1.25, others accept 1.0 or even 0.9)
- Some lenders require 6-12 months of rent history (others don't)

**316 Capital DSCR:**  
- 75-80% LTV
- 7.75-8.5% interest (30-year fixed)
- 1.5 points origination
- DSCR as low as 1.0 accepted
- No income verification
- Works for 1-4 unit properties and small multifamily

---

### Ground-Up Construction Loans

**What it is:**  
Financing for building from scratch—whether it's new construction single-family, duplexes, or small multifamily.

#### Best For:
- Experienced builders (2+ ground-up projects)
- New construction in hot markets where demand exceeds supply
- Adding ADUs (Accessory Dwelling Units) or subdividing lots

#### Typical Terms:
- **LTC:** 80-90% of land + construction costs
- **Interest Rate:** 10-13%
- **Term:** 12-18 months
- **Origination Fee:** 2-4 points
- **Draw Structure:** Typically 5-7 draws tied to construction milestones

**Key feature:** Funds are released in stages as construction progresses (foundation, framing, mechanicals, drywall, completion).

#### When to Use:
- When demand for new construction is strong
- When you can build for less than existing home prices
- When you have an experienced builder and clear plans/permits

#### What to Watch For:
- Longer timelines = higher holding costs
- Permit delays can kill your budget
- Draw inspection fees add up (5-7 inspections at $150-300 each)
- Weather delays are real (especially in Northeast/Midwest)

**316 Capital Ground-Up:**  
- 85% LTC
- 11-12.5% interest
- 3 points origination
- Experienced builders only (2+ projects)
- Fast draw approvals (48-72 hours)

## How to Present Your Deal to Lenders

You've picked the right loan type. Now you need to get approved.

Here's what lenders want to see—and how to package your deal so they say "yes."

---

### What We Want to See

#### 1. Your Experience

**What lenders ask:**
- How many deals have you done?
- What type (flips? Rentals? New construction)?
- How many in the last 12-36 months?
- Any current projects?

**How to present it:**
- Create a **deal resume** (one-page PDF)
- List each project: address, purchase price, sale price (or current value), profit, timeline
- Include photos (before/after) for 2-3 best projects
- If you're new (0-2 deals), highlight your team: contractor, agent, mentor, partners

**What lenders think:**
- 0-2 deals: Higher scrutiny, lower LTV, may require partners or higher credit
- 3-10 deals: You know what you're doing. Standard terms.
- 10+ deals: You're a pro. Best terms, fast approvals.

---

#### 2. Your Credit Profile

**What lenders check:**
- Credit score (FICO)
- Payment history (late payments, collections, judgments)
- Debt-to-income ratio (for conventional loans)
- Bankruptcies or foreclosures (and how long ago)

**Credit score tiers:**
- **720+:** Best rates, highest LTV, fast approvals
- **680-719:** Standard rates, standard terms
- **620-679:** Higher rates, lower LTV, more scrutiny
- **<620:** Hard money or private money only, expect high rates and low LTV

**How to improve your chances:**
- Pull your credit 30 days before applying (dispute errors)
- Pay down credit card balances below 30% utilization
- Don't open new credit accounts right before applying
- If you have collections/judgments, pay them off (or have a payment plan)

---

#### 3. The Deal Numbers

Lenders underwrite the *deal*, not just you.

**What they want to see:**
- Purchase price and contract (signed)
- After-repair value (ARV) with comps
- Rehab budget (line-item breakdown)
- Exit strategy (sale or refinance)
- Timeline (how long will it take?)
- Profit projection (for flips) or cash flow projection (for rentals)

**How to present it:**
- Use the templates from Chapter 3 (Fix & Flip Analyzer, BRRRR Analyzer)
- Provide 3-5 comps (recent sales, similar bed/bath, within 0.5 miles)
- Include photos of the property (exterior and interior)
- Attach your contractor's bid (or scope of work)

**What lenders check:**
- Does the ARV make sense? (Are your comps legit?)
- Is the rehab budget realistic? (Or did you lowball it?)
- Is the margin sufficient? (At least 15-20% equity buffer)
- Is the exit realistic? (Are properties actually selling at that price?)

---

#### 4. Your Exit Strategy

Lenders want to know how they're getting paid back.

**For flips:**  
"We'll sell the property within 6 months. Recent comps show homes selling in 30-45 days at $300K-320K. Our target sale price is $310K."

**For BRRRR:**  
"We'll stabilize the property with a tenant, then refinance after 6 months. Target rent is $2,000/month based on current market comps. We'll refi at 75% LTV with a DSCR loan."

**For new construction:**  
"We'll sell the completed home to an owner-occupant. Builder has pre-sold similar homes in the neighborhood at $450K-500K. Our target is $475K."

**What lenders think:**
- Clear, specific exit = confidence = approval
- Vague exit ("we'll figure it out") = rejection

## Building Lender Relationships That Get You Better Terms

The first deal with a new lender is a test. They're evaluating you as much as the deal.

But if you perform well, the second deal is easier. The third is even easier. By deal 5-10, you're getting preferential treatment.

Here's how to build a relationship that pays off.

---

### 1. Be a Repeat Customer

Lenders love repeat business. It's cheaper for them (less underwriting), faster for you (less scrutiny), and builds trust.

**What it unlocks:**
- Faster approvals (sometimes verbal commitment before full underwriting)
- Better rates (0.25-0.5% discount for repeat borrowers)
- Higher LTV (75% → 80% → 90% as you prove yourself)
- More flexibility (extensions, draw timing, etc.)

**Do this:**  
After your first successful deal, circle back: "Thanks for funding that project. I'm looking at another deal—are you open to funding it?"

Most lenders will fast-track you.

---

### 2. Close When You Say You Will

Nothing kills your reputation faster than missing deadlines.

If you commit to a 14-day close, close in 14 days. If you need more time, communicate *early*—don't wait until the day before.

**Why it matters:**  
Lenders have capital commitments. If they allocate $200K to your deal and you delay, they lose money. Do that twice, and you're on the "difficult borrower" list.

**Do this:**  
Respond to requests fast. Submit documents same-day. If something is delayed, let them know immediately.

---

### 3. Communicate Early and Often

Lenders hate surprises.

If your contractor finds mold and your rehab budget just jumped $10K, tell your lender *now*—not when you submit the next draw request.

If you need an extension, ask 30 days out—not 3 days before the loan expires.

**Do this:**  
Send monthly updates (even if nothing has changed): "Project is on track, framing complete, on schedule for a June refi."

This builds trust and keeps you top of mind for future deals.

---

### 4. Bring Good Deals

Lenders want to deploy capital. But they want to deploy it on *good* deals.

If you bring them marginal deals with thin margins and questionable exits, they'll approve them (maybe)—but reluctantly.

If you bring them strong deals with solid equity, clear exits, and conservative budgets, they'll fight to fund you.

**Do this:**  
Only submit deals that you'd fund with your own money. If you're not confident, don't waste their time.

---

### 5. Pay on Time (Obvious, But Critical)

Late payments destroy your relationship.

If you're struggling to make a payment, call your lender *before* it's late. Most will work with you (short-term forbearance, payment plan, etc.).

But if you just don't pay and ignore their calls? You're done.

**Do this:**  
Set up auto-pay if possible. If not, calendar reminders 5 days before each payment.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Match the loan to the strategy.** Don't use a DSCR loan for a flip. Don't use hard money for a long-term rental.

2. **Present your deal professionally.** A one-page deal summary + comps + photos gets you approved 10x faster than a phone call asking "can you fund my deal?"

3. **Credit matters, but experience matters more.** A 680 credit score with 5 flips will get better terms than a 750 credit score with zero experience.

4. **Build lender relationships.** Your first deal is a test. Your fifth deal is a partnership.

5. **Communicate proactively.** Surprises kill deals. Transparency builds trust.
