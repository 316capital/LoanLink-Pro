# Chapter 2: Lender Red Flags

**Not All Money Is Good Money**

Here's something most real estate gurus won't tell you: the wrong lender can kill a deal faster than a bad foundation.

You found the property. You ran the numbers. The BRRRR math works perfectly. Then your lender hits you with hidden fees, delays your funding, or changes terms at the closing table. Suddenly your "great deal" is underwater.

This chapter is your defense guide. We're going to expose the 10 most common predatory lender tactics, the hidden fees that drain your profits, and the exact questions you should ask before signing anything.

Read this before you borrow another dollar.

## 10 Things Predatory Lenders Do

### Red Flag #1: Excessive Origination Fees (4%+)

Industry standard origination fees range from **1-3 points**. Some lenders charge 4, 5, even 6 points—and bury the disclosure in page 47 of the loan docs.

**The math matters:**
- On a $300K loan, 2 points = $6,000
- On the same loan, 5 points = $15,000
- That's $9,000 straight out of your profit

**What's reasonable:**
| Experience Level | Typical Origination |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Newbie (0-2 deals) | 2-3 points |
| Experienced (3-10 deals) | 1.5-2 points |
| Volume borrower (10+) | 1-1.5 points |

If someone's charging 4+ points and you have decent experience, walk away.

### Red Flag #2: Hidden Junk Fees

"Processing fee." "Admin fee." "Underwriting fee." "Doc prep fee." "Wire fee." "Funding fee."

These are **junk fees**—charges designed to pad the lender's profit after they've quoted you a "competitive" rate.

**Common junk fees to watch for:**
- Processing fee: $500-1,500
- Underwriting fee: $500-1,000
- Admin/application fee: $200-500
- Doc prep fee: $300-750
- Funding fee: $500-1,000
- Wire fee: $50-150

Individually, they seem small. Together? That's $2,500-5,000 added to your costs.

**The fix:** Ask for a **complete fee breakdown in writing** before you apply. If they can't give you a clear answer, that's your answer.

---

### Red Flag #3: Yield Spread Premiums

This is a sneaky one. A **yield spread premium (YSP)** is when your broker gets paid by the lender for putting you in a higher-rate loan than you qualify for.

Here's how it works:
- You qualify for 9% interest
- Broker puts you in an 11% loan
- Lender pays the broker a 1-2% commission on the spread

You never see this fee. It's built into your rate. Over a 12-month loan, that extra 2% on $300K is **$6,000** you didn't know you were paying.

**How to spot it:** Ask directly: *"Are you receiving any compensation from the lender based on my rate?"* Honest brokers disclose. Shady ones deflect.

---

### Red Flag #4: Prepayment Penalties

Some hard money and bridge lenders charge **prepayment penalties** if you pay off the loan early. This is backwards—they're penalizing you for being successful.

**Common penalty structures:**
- Minimum interest guarantee (6-12 months interest no matter what)
- Step-down penalty (3% year 1, 2% year 2, 1% year 3)
- Yield maintenance (complex calculation designed to confuse you)

If you're doing a BRRRR and planning to refinance in 4-6 months, a 12-month minimum interest guarantee just killed your returns.

**Always ask:** *"What happens if I pay this loan off in 3 months? 6 months? What are the penalties?"*

---

### Red Flag #5: Excessive Draw Inspection Fees

Rehab loans release funds in **draws**—you complete work, inspector verifies, lender releases funds. Reasonable.

What's not reasonable: charging $150-250 per inspection when you need 4-6 draws on a project.

**The math:**
- 5 draws × $200/inspection = $1,000

Some lenders charge $75-100 per inspection. Others charge $250. Same service. Different greed level.

**Also watch for:**
- "Re-inspection fees" if you fail the first inspection
- "Expedited inspection fees" to get your draw faster
- "Final inspection fees" that are higher than regular draws

---

### Red Flag #6: Unclear Extension Terms

Your rehab ran 2 months long. It happens. Now you need to extend your loan.

**Red flag lender:** *"Extensions are $5,000 plus 2 additional points, and we need to re-underwrite the file."*

**Reasonable lender:** *"Extensions are 1 point per month, no re-underwriting, just pay the fee and we're good."*

Extension terms should be **clearly defined in your original loan docs.** If the lender is vague about extensions, they're planning to squeeze you later when you're desperate.

**Get it in writing upfront:**
- Cost per month of extension
- Maximum number of extensions allowed
- Any additional requirements (updated appraisal, etc.)

---

### Red Flag #7: Personal Guarantees on Everything

Most hard money loans require a personal guarantee. That's standard.

What's NOT standard:
- Guaranteeing the full loan amount when you've put 20%+ down
- Guaranteeing for the full term when you're only using 6 months
- Unlimited personal liability with no carve-outs for bad acts vs. market conditions

**What's reasonable:**
- Carve-out guarantees (you're liable for fraud, waste, intentional damage—not market downturns)
- Burn-off provisions (guarantee reduces as you pay down)
- Limited recourse based on your equity position

If a lender wants unlimited personal guarantee with no carve-outs, negotiate or walk.

---

### Red Flag #8: No Clear Path to Funding

*"We're in underwriting."*
*"We're waiting on the appraisal."*
*"Should be any day now."*
*"Just need one more thing..."*

If you can't get a straight answer on **when your loan will fund**, something's wrong.

**Legitimate timeline:**
1. Application to approval: 24-72 hours
2. Approval to clear-to-close: 5-10 business days
3. Clear-to-close to funding: 3-5 business days

Total: **2-3 weeks** for most hard money loans.

If you're at week 4 with no clear closing date, the lender either:
- Doesn't have the capital to fund
- Is shopping your deal to other investors
- Is incompetent

None of those are acceptable.

---

### Red Flag #9: Bait-and-Switch Rate Changes

You were quoted 9%. You liked 9%. You structured your deal around 9%.

Now, at the closing table, it's 10.5%.

*"Oh, your credit score was 2 points lower than expected."*
*"The appraisal came in light."*
*"Market conditions changed."*

This is the **bait-and-switch**, and it's more common than you'd think.

**Protection strategies:**
- Get a **rate lock** in writing with clear conditions
- Ask what triggers rate changes and get it documented
- If the rate changes at closing, be prepared to walk (have a backup lender)

---

### Red Flag #10: Pressure Tactics and Rushed Closings

*"This rate expires Friday."*
*"We have another borrower interested in your file."*
*"Sign now or we can't guarantee funding."*

These are **pressure tactics** designed to prevent you from reading the fine print or shopping other options.

Legitimate lenders don't operate this way. Good capital is patient.

If someone's rushing you to sign, ask yourself: **What don't they want me to see?**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ask about ALL fees before you apply.** Get it in writing.

2. **Understand your prepayment terms.** Especially on BRRRR deals where you'll refi in 6 months.

3. **Rate-lock in writing.** Bait-and-switch is real.

4. **Know your extension terms upfront.** Rehabs always take longer than planned.

5. **Trust your gut.** If a lender feels pushy or evasive, they probably are.

6. **Have a backup.** Always have a second lender relationship for leverage and emergencies.

The right capital partner accelerates your business. The wrong one kills deals. Choose wisely.
