# Chapter 3: Deal Analysis Templates

**Numbers Don't Lie—But You Can Lie to Yourself**

You're staring at a potential deal. The house is ugly. The price seems right. Your gut says "buy it."

But your gut doesn't care about holding costs, exit fees, or whether the ARV is based on actual comps or Zillow fantasies.

This is where most investors fail—not because they can't find deals, but because they analyze them wrong (or don't analyze them at all).

They round in their favor. They ignore costs. They assume best-case scenarios. Then they wonder why the deal that "penciled out" on a napkin ended up losing $15,000.

**The antidote? Math. Cold, hard, unforgiving math.**

This chapter gives you the frameworks, formulas, and checklists to analyze any deal with precision. We'll cover:
- Fix & Flip analysis
- BRRRR analysis
- Rental cash flow projections
- The 10-question Go/No-Go checklist

By the end, you'll have templates you can use on your next deal—today.

## Fix & Flip Analyzer Framework

The fix-and-flip model is simple: Buy low, fix fast, sell high, pocket the difference.

But "simple" doesn't mean "easy." Every cost you miss, every timeline you miss, eats into your profit.

Here's the step-by-step framework.

---

### Inputs You Need

#### 1. Purchase and Acquisition Costs

| Input | What It Is | Where to Get It |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Purchase Price** | What you're paying for the property | Offer/contract |
| **Closing Costs (Purchase)** | Title, escrow, recording fees | 2-3% of purchase price |
| **Earnest Money Deposit** | Deposit to secure the deal | Typically $1,000-5,000 |
| **Inspection Fees** | Home inspection, pest, etc. | $400-800 |
| **Due Diligence Costs** | Any pre-purchase expenses | Varies |

**Example:**
```
Purchase Price:         $180,000
Closing Costs (2.5%):   $4,500
Inspection:             $500
TOTAL ACQUISITION:      $185,000
```

---

#### 2. Rehab Budget

Walk the property with your contractor. Line-item everything.

**Major categories:**
- Exterior (roof, siding, paint, landscaping)
- Kitchen (cabinets, counters, appliances, flooring)
- Bathrooms (tile, vanity, fixtures, flooring)
- Flooring (throughout)
- Paint (interior)
- Electrical (panel, outlets, fixtures)
- Plumbing (water heater, fixtures, rough-in)
- HVAC (repair or replace)
- Structural (if needed)
- Permits and inspections
- Contingency (10-15%)

**Example:**
```
Kitchen:         $15,000
Bathrooms (2):   $10,000
Flooring:        $6,000
Paint:           $3,500
Roof:            $9,000
HVAC:            $5,500
Electrical:      $3,000
Landscaping:     $2,500
Permits:         $1,200
Contingency:     $5,570 (10%)
TOTAL REHAB:     $61,270
```

**Round up.** If your contractor says $60K, budget $65K. You'll thank yourself later.

---

#### 3. Holding Costs

Every month you own the property costs money.

| Cost | Monthly | How to Calculate |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Loan Interest** | Varies | (Loan amount × interest rate) / 12 |
| **Property Taxes** | Varies | Annual taxes / 12 |
| **Insurance** | $150-300 | Get a quote |
| **Utilities** | $200-400 | Electric, gas, water, sewer (if vacant) |
| **HOA Fees** | Varies | Check HOA docs |

**Example (6-month hold):**
```
Loan interest (12% on $200K):  $2,000/mo × 6 = $12,000
Property taxes:                $400/mo × 6 = $2,400
Insurance:                     $200/mo × 6 = $1,200
Utilities:                     $300/mo × 6 = $1,800
TOTAL HOLDING COSTS:           $17,400
```

**Pro tip:** Most flips take longer than you expect. Budget for 6 months even if your contractor says 3.

---

#### 4. Financing Costs

| Cost | Typical Range | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Origination Fee** | 2-3 points | % of loan amount |
| **Underwriting/Processing** | $0-1,500 | Should be included in origination |
| **Appraisal** | $400-600 | One-time |
| **Draw Inspection Fees** | $100-300 per draw | Typically 3-5 draws |

**Example:**
```
Loan Amount:         $200,000
Origination (2.5%):  $5,000
Appraisal:           $500
Draw Inspections (4): $400
TOTAL FINANCING:     $5,900
```

---

#### 5. Exit Costs

When you sell, you pay to get out.

| Cost | Typical Range |
|------|---------------|
| **Real Estate Commission** | 5-6% of sale price |
| **Closing Costs (Sale)** | 1-2% of sale price |
| **Staging** | $1,500-3,000 (optional but recommended) |
| **Photography** | $200-400 |

**Example (selling at $300K):**
```
Commission (6%):     $18,000
Closing Costs (1.5%): $4,500
Staging:             $2,000
Photography:         $300
TOTAL EXIT COSTS:    $24,800
```

---

### The Flip Formula

Now add it all up:

```
TOTAL COST = Purchase + Acquisition + Rehab + Holding + Financing + Exit

PROFIT = Sale Price - Total Cost

ROI = Profit / Cash Invested

Annualized ROI = (Profit / Cash Invested) × (12 / Months Held)
```

**Example:**
```
Purchase:          $180,000
Acquisition:       $5,000
Rehab:             $61,270
Holding (6 mo):    $17,400
Financing:         $5,900
Exit:              $24,800
TOTAL COST:        $294,370

Sale Price:        $320,000
PROFIT:            $25,630

Cash Invested:     $80,000 (down payment + rehab fronted)
ROI:               32%
Annualized ROI:    64% (6-month project)
```

---

### What "Good" Looks Like

**Minimum flip targets:**
- **Profit:** $20,000+ (absolute minimum $15K)
- **ROI:** 25%+ on cash invested
- **Annualized ROI:** 40%+ 
- **Margin:** 8-10% of ARV (to absorb surprises)

**If your numbers don't hit these targets, walk away or renegotiate the purchase price.**

**What happened?**

This deal doesn't work. The investor would *lose* money.

**Why?**
- Purchase price was too high relative to ARV
- Holding period extended due to permit delays (budget was 5 months, actual was 7)
- Exit costs in Boston are high (5.5% commission is standard for multi-families)

**How to fix it:**
- Negotiate purchase price down to $575,000 (would create $50K profit)
- OR target a higher sale price ($900K+) by adding value (converting basement to additional unit, securing rent rolls showing strong income)
- OR skip the flip and BRRRR it (refi instead of sell)

**This is why you analyze BEFORE you buy.**

---

## BRRRR Analyzer Framework

BRRRR analysis is similar to flipping—except instead of selling, you're refinancing and holding.

The goal: Pull out 80-100% of your capital and still have the property cash flow.

---

### Inputs You Need

1. **Purchase + Acquisition Costs** (same as flip)
2. **Rehab Budget** (same as flip)
3. **Holding Costs During Rehab** (same as flip)
4. **Financing Costs** (origination, interest during rehab)
5. **Rental Income** (what will it rent for after rehab?)
6. **Refinance Terms** (LTV, interest rate, term)
7. **Operating Expenses** (taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancy, PM)

---

### The BRRRR Formula

**Phase 1: Acquisition + Rehab**
```
Total Cost = Purchase + Acquisition + Rehab + Holding + Financing
```

**Phase 2: Refinance**
```
ARV = After-Repair Value (based on appraisal)
Refinance Loan Amount = ARV × LTV (typically 75-80%)
Capital Recovered = Refinance Loan Amount - Closing Costs
Cash Left in Deal = Total Cost - Capital Recovered
```

**Phase 3: Cash Flow**
```
Monthly Income = Rent
Monthly Expenses = PITI + Maintenance + Vacancy + PM
Monthly Cash Flow = Income - Expenses

Cash-on-Cash Return = (Annual Cash Flow / Cash Left in Deal) × 100
```

**If Cash Left in Deal = $0, you have infinite return.**

---

### Cash-on-Cash Return vs. Infinite Return

**Cash-on-Cash Return:**  
This is your annual cash flow divided by the cash you have in the deal.

**Example:**
```
Annual Cash Flow:   $3,600 ($300/month)
Cash in Deal:       $30,000
Cash-on-Cash Return: 12%
```

**Infinite Return:**  
If you pull out 100% of your capital, your cash-on-cash return is infinite (dividing by zero).

Even $1/month in cash flow = infinite return when you have $0 in the deal.

**This is the magic of BRRRR.**

### EXAMPLE: Philadelphia Row Home BRRRR

**Property:** 3-bed, 1-bath row home in Strawberry Mansion, Philadelphia  
**Condition:** Vacant, needs full rehab  
**Strategy:** BRRRR to build rental portfolio

#### Acquisition
```
Purchase Price:         $85,000
Closing Costs (3%):     $2,550
Inspection:             $400
TOTAL ACQUISITION:      $87,950
```

#### Financing (Acquisition + Rehab)
```
Bridge Loan Amount (85% LTC): $148,000
Down Payment (15%):     $26,000
Origination Fee (2 pts): $2,960
Interest Rate:          11%
Term:                   12 months
```

#### Rehab Budget
```
Kitchen:                $13,000
Bathroom:               $6,500
Flooring (LVP):         $4,500
Paint:                  $2,500
Roof Repair:            $3,500
HVAC (new):             $5,000
Electrical:             $3,500
Plumbing:               $2,500
Exterior:               $2,000
Permits:                $1,000
Contingency (10%):      $4,400
TOTAL REHAB:            $48,400
```

#### Holding Costs (4 months)
```
Loan Interest:          $1,357/mo × 4 = $5,428
Property Taxes:         $200/mo × 4 = $800
Insurance:              $150/mo × 4 = $600
Utilities:              $250/mo × 4 = $1,000
TOTAL HOLDING:          $7,828
```

#### Total Cost
```
Purchase + Acquisition:  $87,950
Rehab:                   $48,400
Holding:                 $7,828
Financing (origination): $2,960
TOTAL ALL-IN:            $147,138
```

#### Refinance (6 Months After Completion)
```
ARV (Appraisal):         $195,000
Refinance LTV:           75%
Refinance Loan Amount:   $146,250
Closing Costs (2%):      -$2,925
Net Proceeds:            $143,325

Cash Left in Deal:       $147,138 - $143,325 = $3,813
```

**You recovered 97.4% of your capital. Nearly infinite return.**

#### Cash Flow Analysis
```
Monthly Rent:            $1,650

Monthly Expenses:
- Mortgage (P&I):        $1,055 (7.5%, 30yr on $146,250)
- Property Taxes:        $200
- Insurance:             $150
- Maintenance (10%):     $165
- Vacancy (5%):          $83
- Property Mgmt (8%):    $132
TOTAL EXPENSES:          $1,785

Monthly Cash Flow:       $1,650 - $1,785 = -$135
```

**Wait—negative cash flow again?**

Yes. But look at the full picture:

**Annual Returns:**
- Cash in deal: $3,813
- Annual cash flow: -$1,620 (negative)
- Principal paydown: $3,850/year
- Appreciation (3% annually): $5,850
- Tax benefits (depreciation): ~$6,000
- **NET GAIN: $14,080**

**ROI on $3,813 invested:** 369%

**Plus:** In 2-3 years, rents will grow 4-5% annually, and you'll be cash-flow positive.

**This is a great BRRRR deal.**

## Rental Cash Flow Worksheet

Whether you're doing a BRRRR or buying a turnkey rental, you need to project cash flow accurately.

Here's the framework.

---

### Income Side

**Gross Rental Income:**  
What tenants pay you each month.

```
Unit 1: $1,200
Unit 2: $1,200
Unit 3: $1,100
Total Gross Income: $3,500/month = $42,000/year
```

**Other Income (Optional):**
- Laundry coin-op
- Parking fees
- Pet fees
- Storage fees

---

### Expense Side

Here's every expense you need to account for:

| Expense | How to Calculate |
|---------|------------------|
| **Property Taxes** | Check county records |
| **Insurance** | Get quote from insurer |
| **HOA/Condo Fees** | Check HOA docs |
| **Mortgage (P&I)** | Use amortization calculator |
| **Maintenance** | 10% of gross rent (or $100/unit/month) |
| **Vacancy** | 5-8% of gross rent |
| **Property Management** | 8-10% of gross rent (if using PM) |
| **Utilities** | If landlord-paid (water/sewer, trash common in multi-family) |
| **CapEx Reserve** | $50-100/unit/month (roof, HVAC, appliances) |
| **Lawn/Snow** | If applicable |

**Example:**
```
Property Taxes:  $400/mo
Insurance:       $200/mo
Mortgage (P&I):  $1,800/mo
Maintenance:     $350/mo (10% of $3,500)
Vacancy:         $175/mo (5%)
PM:              $280/mo (8%)
CapEx:           $150/mo ($50 × 3 units)
TOTAL EXPENSES:  $3,355/mo
```

---

### The 50% Rule

A quick shortcut: **Half of your gross rental income will go to expenses (excluding mortgage).**

```
Gross Rent:      $3,500/mo
50% Rule:        $1,750/mo in expenses
Mortgage:        $1,800/mo
Cash Flow:       $3,500 - $1,750 - $1,800 = -$50/mo
```

This is a rough estimate—use the detailed method above for accuracy. But the 50% Rule is useful for quick screening.

---

### Net Operating Income (NOI)

NOI is your income minus operating expenses (but *before* debt service).

```
Gross Income:         $42,000/year
Operating Expenses:   -$21,000/year (taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancy, PM, CapEx)
NOI:                  $21,000/year
```

**Why NOI matters:**  
Lenders and investors use NOI to value properties. A higher NOI = a more valuable property.

---

### Cash Flow After Debt Service

```
NOI:                  $21,000/year
Annual Debt Service:  -$21,600/year (mortgage payments)
Cash Flow:            -$600/year (-$50/month)
```

If cash flow is negative, ask:
- Is the property appreciating?
- Am I getting principal paydown?
- Are there tax benefits?
- Will rents grow enough to turn it positive soon?

If the answer is "no" to all of the above, don't buy.

---

## The Go/No-Go Decision Checklist

Before you commit to any deal, run through this 10-question checklist.

### 1. Does the deal meet your minimum return threshold?

**For flips:** 25% ROI minimum, $20K profit minimum  
**For BRRRR:** 80%+ capital recovery, positive or break-even cash flow  
**For rentals:** 8% cash-on-cash return minimum

If it doesn't hit your targets, walk away.

---

### 2. Is the neighborhood trajectory positive?

Check:
- Crime trends (are they improving or worsening?)
- School ratings (stable or improving?)
- Job growth (are employers moving in or out?)
- New development (are there new businesses, infrastructure projects?)

If the neighborhood is declining, even a "good deal" will turn bad.

---

### 3. Can you clearly identify the buyer/tenant profile?

**For flips:** Who's buying? First-time homebuyers? Investors? Retirees?  
**For rentals:** Who's renting? Young professionals? Families? Section 8?

If you can't answer this, you don't understand the market.

---

### 4. Do you have adequate contingency reserves (10-15%)?

Shit happens. Roofs leak. Contractors ghost. Inspectors find problems.

If your budget has no buffer, you're gambling.

---

### 5. Is your exit strategy realistic?

**For flips:** Are there recent comps supporting your sale price? Are those comps actually closed sales (not listings)?

**For BRRRR:** Will the property appraise high enough to pull your capital out?

**For rentals:** Can you realistically rent it at your projected rate?

If your exit requires best-case scenarios, rethink the deal.

---

### 6. Have you verified comps within the last 30 days?

Comps from 6 months ago are useless. Markets move.

Pull fresh comps (sold in last 60 days, within 0.5 miles, similar bed/bath/sqft).

---

### 7. Do you have a reliable contractor with availability?

The best deal in the world is worthless if you can't execute the rehab.

Confirm your contractor:
- Is available to start within 2 weeks
- Has capacity to finish on time
- Has references you've verified
- Provides a written bid

---

### 8. Can you fund all costs through closing + 30 days?

Don't assume the rehab will go smoothly. Budget for 30 days of unexpected delays and cost overruns.

If you're cutting it close financially, you're one surprise away from disaster.

---

### 9. Does the property pass the "drive test"?

Go see it. Walk the neighborhood. Drive around.

Would *you* live there? Would *you* buy there?

If the answer is no, don't assume someone else will.

---

### 10. Would you still do the deal if everything cost 10% more?

Add 10% to your rehab budget. Add 10% to your holding costs. Reduce your sale price by 5%.

Does the deal still work?

If yes, it's a solid deal.  
If no, you're too thin. Walk away.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always analyze on paper before you buy.** Gut feelings lose money. Math makes money.

2. **Use conservative assumptions.** Budget high on costs, low on income. If the deal works in the worst case, it's a good deal.

3. **Don't ignore holding costs.** Every extra month costs you $2,000-5,000. Factor it in.

4. **Verify your comps.** Don't trust Zillow. Pull actual closed sales.

5. **Run the 10-question checklist** on every deal. If you answer "no" to more than 2 questions, walk away.

6. **Use the templates in this chapter.** Print them. Laminate them. Use them on every deal.
